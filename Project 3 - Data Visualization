## Project Proposal:

**Use weather data to see how it affects air travel at the ten most popular US cities.**

## Assumptions:

The following questions and answers helped determine the required data, the analysis, and the visualizations:

  * **Q:**What are the 10 most popular US cities based on passenger arrivals?
  
  * **Q:**What months are the most popular for each city?

  * **Q:**What is the average weather condition in each city per month?

  * **Q:**What cities were preferrred over the others based on average temperatures for the year?

  * **Q:**Based on the analysis of historical data, what is the best month to travel next year?

  * **Q:**Based on the analysis, what is the best city to travel to next year?
