          <p>
            Collectively, our team conceptualized our goals for this Project. Tasked with creating visualizations using an API via a HTML web page, incorporating Javascript, and a SQL Database we got right to work. By integrating scheduled flight patterns from the top 10 US airports by volume with weather data from those locations, we were able to fulfill this project's requirements and learn about the dynamic air-travel industry as well as the different weather patterns nationwide.

                  My name is Gerardo Angulo, but most people call me Jerry. My favorite hobby is indoor rock climbing because it's physically demanding and each route is a puzzle you have to solve. A technical skill I’m confident in is Python because I have spent the most time using this language. After completing UCI’s Data Analysis Bootcamp, I want to find a job as a data analyst in either marketing, finance, or sports.

                  Hello, my name is Luis Hernandez. I am an educator of 5+ years in the South Los Angeles community teaching Common Core Math. At the moment, I am currently enrolled in a data analytics boot camp for UCI Irvine. I enjoy the data analytics bootcamp in which I am learning about different programming languages and how they take information and answer questions that are of interest. I am hoping to start a new career as a data analyst and incorporate my teaching skills by helping others through collaborative projects and tasks. Some of my hobbies include collecting vintage items from my childhood, playing the guitar and playing billiards. Thank you for your time to read this about me and have a great day!

                    I am a financial analyst with a background in banking and healthcare. My Excel skills are self-taught while skills in VBA, Python, and SQL were acquired from UCI where I earned a certificate in data analytics and visualization. I comfortably navigate through large datasets and transform them into meaningful and digestible content. My analytical problem-solving abilities, combined with strengths in creating dashboards for diverse audiences, make me a valuable addition to any team. When I'm not buried in data, I love to be outdoors, either at the beach, on a hike or simply in the quiet of nature.

                    My name is Vasanta Prayaga. I have over 15 years of experience working in diverse fields like teaching,
                    Software testing and Data Analysis. My experience working with different databases both relational and
                    non-relational give me a good foundation for data analysis.
                    I feel confident in using SQL with different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, MS
                    Access, Mongo DB. I am also proficient with object-oriented programming languages like Python, Java,
                    C++. I have also had the opportunity to learn a lot of web development and visualization tools like HTML,
                    CSS, JS , D3, Bootstrap and Tableau in this bootcamp.
                    I plan to use all the skills I am learning in the bootcamp to get better at Data Analysis and come up with
                    great visualizations.
                    I am also a watercolor artist and a passionate organic gardener.

                      Hello, my name is Scott Dutton. I have been working at Boeing in Long Beach for nearly six years, and I am in a division of the company that modifies the interiors of airplanes for airline customers. My team provides solutions to any issues that might come up during the modification, and I support the team as the manager. The company generates a ton of data in all aspects of doing business. I think the data can be better utilized to help us in making decisions, operate more efficiently, and make our customers happier. I have enrolled in this data analytics boot camp to help me pull the data together so I can demonstrate better usage. The course has been very fast-paced for me, but it has made me want to continue with more classes afterwards. I think I am lucky to be working at a company where I will be able to directly apply this knowledge. I enjoy reading, hiking, biking, and traveling as my hobbies. The two cats in my arms are 19 year-old sisters. The light-gray one is still missing her sister who just passed away two months ago.
