## Project Proposal:

**Use weather data to see how it affects air travel at the ten most popular US cities.**

## Assumptions:

We sought to find answers to the following questions:

  **Question:** What are the 10 most popular US cities based on passenger arrivals?
  
  **Question:** What months are the most popular for each city?

  **Question:** What is the average weather condition in each city per month?

  **Question:** What cities were preferrred over the others based on average temperatures for the year?

  **Question:** Based on the analysis of historical data, what is the best month to travel next year?

  **Question:** Based on the analysis, what is the best city to travel to next year?

  ## Resources:

  * [United States Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=1)

  		* Output:  10 CSV files
  		* Description: one CSV file for each city with monthly passenger arrival data between 2011 - 2021 

  * [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search)

  		* Output:  monthly_summary.csv 
  		* Description: one CSV file with monthly weather data for all 25 airports between 2011 - 2022

## Data Delivery

Collectively, our team conceptualized our goals for this Project. Tasked with creating visualizations using an API via a HTML web page, incorporating Javascript, and a SQL Database we got right to work. By integrating scheduled flight patterns from the top 10 US airports by volume with weather data from those locations, we were able to fulfill this project's requirements and learn about the dynamic air-travel industry as well as the different weather patterns nationwide.
